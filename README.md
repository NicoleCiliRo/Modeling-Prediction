This work was completed as part of my Master’s degree in Data Analysis, Big Data, and Business Analytics, where I developed and trained predictive models with the goal of achieving optimal performance. I was responsible for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation, using standard data science libraries and performance metrics to compare and optimize results.
